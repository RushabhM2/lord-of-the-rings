# Getting started
This app uses 2 backend packes, Express and CORS. To install these run
`npm install` when in the **server** folder.

To start the app, run `node index.js` when in the **server** folder.

You'll then be able to view the running app on `http://localhost:3001/`

The server will serve the front end files, so running this on the browser will be enough to view and play the game.
